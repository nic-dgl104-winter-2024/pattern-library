# Project Overview
The Template Method design pattern is implemented in Java in this project. The Template Method pattern assigns some of the work to subclasses while defining the general structure of an algorithm within a method. It encourages code reusability and flexibility by enabling subclasses to rewrite specific phases of an algorithm without altering its structure.

# Prerequisites
* Set up Java development environment. Ensure you have the Java Development Kit (JDK) installed on your machine.
* Create a new Java project in your preferred Integrated Development Environment (IDE) such as Eclipse, IntelliJ IDEA, or NetBeans.
* Inside the Java project, create a package named templatemethod to organize your classes.
* Create an abstract class named AbstractTemplate within the templatemethod package. This class will define the template method and placeholder methods that subclasses can override.
* Create concrete subclasses that extend AbstractTemplate and provide implementations for the placeholder methods.

# Getting Started
* Fork the repository: [(https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/pattern-library.git)](https://github.com/nic-dgl104-winter-2024/pattern-library.git)
* Create a development branch on the fork repository
* Made changes on the branch according to the issue identified
* Created a separate CONTRIBUTING.md and README.md
* Open the project in your preferred Java IDE.
* Made changes or additions and push to branch
* Test your changes locally.
* Create a pull request with a clear description of your changes.

# Code Style
Follow the Java code style guidelines recommended by Oracle https://www.oracle.com/ca-en/java/ for consistency and readability.

# Testing
The lines of code were tested internally to ensure that changes do not break existing functionality. Unit tests were done to cover new features or modifications.

# Code Review Process
All contributions are reviewed before merging. Ensured the code follows best practices and is well-documented. So that you know- I addressed feedback received during the code review promptly.

# Documentation
Kept the codebase well-documented using meaningful variable/method names and comments where necessary. Updates the README.md file with relevant information about the project and how to run/use it.
