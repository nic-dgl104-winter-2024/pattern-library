# âœ¨ JavaScript Function Implementation of Observer Pattern

## Introduction

The Observer pattern is a behavioral design pattern that lets objects subscribe to events and receive notifications when those events happen. The independent 

object (known as a subject) notifies other objects (observers) when its state changes. This pattern is commonly used in JavaScript to implement event handling systems

It's fundamental to event-driven programming, especially in JavaScript, promoting flexible and loosely coupled design.

Take a look at the diagram below.

The Subject has three methods to subscribe, unsubscribe, and notify its list of Observers.
The Observers are interested in knowing about the Subject's state changes, like button click events. So they must subscribe to the Subject to be notified. When a user clicks the button, the observers update the user interface to reflect the user activity.

Consider the Facebook Page as an example. Facebook Page acts as the Subject which has a list of followers (observers) who wish to receive updates. And it has the following methods:
- Subscribe: A user subscribes by Following
- Unsubscribe: They can unsubscribe by Unfollowing the page
- Notify: It notifies all followers (observers) whenever there is a new post and every time a user engages with it. Then the user's UI updates in real-time to show the post and comments on their feed.

Now, let's dive deeper into this pattern with the below discussion on its key aspects.

1. Subject Implementation
Subject (Observable):
- The `ButtonSubject` constructor represents the Subject.
- It initializes an array `observersList` to hold observer functions.
- Provides methods `subscribe`, `unsubscribe`, and `notify`.

``` javascript
// Define a constructor function for the Subject object
function ButtonSubject() {
  this.observersList = []; // Array to hold observer functions
}

// Extend the prototype of the ButtonSubject object with methods for subscribing, unsubscribing, and notifing observers
ButtonSubject.prototype = {
  // Method to subscribe an observer
  subscribe: function (observer) {
    this.observersList.push(observer);
  },
  // Method to unsubscribe an observer
  unsubscribe: function (observerToRemove) {
    // Remove the observerToRemove from the array by finding its index
    const index = this.observersList.indexOf(observerToRemove);
    if (index !== -1) {
      this.observersList.splice(index, 1);
    }
  },

  // Method to notify all observers
  notify: function (buttonId) {
    // Call each observer function based on the button clicked
    for (const observer of this.observersList) {
      observer(buttonId);
    }
  },
};

// Instantiate a new ButtonSubject object
const buttonSubject = new ButtonSubject();

// Function to handle button click events and notify observers
function sendButtonClickNotif(event) {
  buttonSubject.notify(event.target.id);
}
```

2. Observer Implementation
Observer (Subscriber):
- Observer function is registered as observer using the `subscribe` method, listening for notifications from the `ButtonSubject`.
- It takes buttonId as a parameter, which is the id of the button that triggers the notification.
- The observer function updates the content of the HTML element with id `output` to update the UI.

``` javascript
 // Subscribe the observer function to the buttonSubject
      buttonSubject.subscribe(function (buttonId) {
        const message = `Observer of ${buttonId} has been notified\n`;
        document.getElementById("output").textContent = message;  
      });
```

3. Subscription Mechanism:
- Event listeners are attached to the buttons (`button1` and `button2`) to trigger the notification process when clicked.

``` javascript
// Attach event listeners to the buttons for click events
document
  .getElementById("button1")
  .addEventListener("click", sendButtonClickNotif);
document
  .getElementById("button2")
  .addEventListener("click", sendButtonClickNotif);
```

4. Notification
- When a button is clicked, the `sendButtonClickNotif` function is triggered and then invokes the `notify` method of the `ButtonSubject`.
- `notify` method calls each observer function, passing the `buttonId` as an argument. This ensures that all subscribed observers are notified of the button click event.
- This then goes back to the Observer function receiving the `buttonId` as a parameter and updates the UI by setting the textContent of the HTML element. This allows responsive user interaction as UI updates occur after the button click event has been handled.

``` javascript
// Function to handle button click events and notify observers
function sendButtonClickNotif(event) {
  buttonSubject.notify(event.target.id);
}
```

Event-Driven

The entire mechanism operates in event-driven programming. Observers listen to button click events and respond by updating the UI. 

In the whole, Observer Pattern shows how it can be useful when working with event-based interactions.
