# Singleton - php

## Explanation

The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global access point to it. This creational design pattern is useful when you want to control access to a single instance of a class, typically for resource management or logging purposes.

## Features

1. Single Instance: Ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to it.
2. Global Access: Provides a way to access the instance without the need to create a new one each time.
3. Lazy Initialization: The instance is created only when it is requested for the first time, improving performance.
4. Thread Safety: Ensures that the singleton instance is created safely in a multi-threaded environment.
5. Private Constructor: Prevents external classes from instantiating the singleton class directly.

## PROS & CONS

PROS:- The Singleton pattern ensures that a class has only one instance, allowing global access to that instance. This is useful when you need to control access to a single resource across the application. The singleton object is initialized lazily, meaning it is created only when it is first requested, improving efficiency. This pattern is commonly used in logging, caching, and database connection classes.

CONS:- The Singleton pattern violates the Single Responsibility Principle by solving two problems simultaneously. It can also hide poor design practices, where components are overly aware of each other. Additionally, in a multithreaded environment, special precautions are necessary to prevent multiple instantiation. Unit testing client code of the Singleton can be challenging due to limitations in mocking frameworks, as the private constructor and static methods are difficult to override. This complexity may lead to the avoidance of the Singleton pattern altogether.
